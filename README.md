# HomeAssistant Configuration Backup

This is my personal configuration backup repository for my home automation system using [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)

## General Approach

Piece by Piece it seems, originally I had 2 Phillips Hue lights and wanted to do a bit more with them. Add in a few echo dots and start wondering how to make them do more with the little I have. Then it was monitoring our freezer while we went away for long trips and knew it had a habit of shutting off. Now I am discovering more and more clever uses and wondering what else I could do with this and what to buy next...

## Device List:
